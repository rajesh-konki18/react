React
    Client side Javascript library

why react instead just JS?
    complexity on adding handlers
    need to write every single step that happen
    imperitive approach 
    React make use every element as small building blocks
    maintainable and manageble

 Single Page applications

    let vs const

        creating variables
        const - never changed

    jsbin.com // online js editor

    Array Functions
              const myFun = () =>{}
              const myFun = name => {}  //correct as single param.
              const myFun = name, age => {} //wrong
              const myFun = (name, age) => {} 
              const myFun = num => num * 2     

    Exports & Imports(Modules)
        export ----> import
        default exports vs named exports

    classes
        Blueprints of objects
        properties and methods
        create object with new keyword.
        inheritance support with extends keyword.

            class Person{
                constructor(){
                    this.name = 'Raj';
                }

                printMyName(){
                    console.log(this.name);
                }
            }   

    classes, properties and methods
    spread and Rest operators
        ... => split array objects (spread)  
        ... => function myFun(...arg){   // (Rest) get unlimited no of args.

        }
